<p><b>Comments Script Information.</b></p>
<p>I wrote this script for something to do... it was very simple (just took me 4 
hours) and requires no databases whatsoever.<br>
<br>
The script is available for download in my downloads page, its in a ZIP archive 
(if you can't unzip the archive, don't bother with the script).<br>
<br>
The only program I used to create the script was the notepad program which comes 
with Windows, I used FrontPage to make the form... cause I'm lazy.</p>
<p>The script is by no means perfect, I still have a couple of things to sort 
out on it, but when adjustments are made I'll upload the new file to my site and 
upgrade the ZIP archive too.<br>
<br>
Please do not take my script, and change my name to your own, when the rest of 
the code is still the same it won't be hard to tell that you've copied my 
script.</p>
<p>If you find any major bugs be sure to let me know, all you need to use the 
script is a FTP Client which supports CHMOD'ing, a text editor to change file 
locations if need be, and a web hosting account which supports PHP (no fancy 
code, this'll run perfect on even the older versions)!</p>
